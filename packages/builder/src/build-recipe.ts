/**
 * Running a build recipe, and checking that a recipe still produces what it
 * claims. This is the half of `keel-build-recipe` that needs a filesystem
 * and a bundler; the structure and the digest live in `@keel/protocol` so a
 * browser can hold a recipe without being able to execute one.
 *
 * The point of the pair is that a creator can keep readable TypeScript in a
 * public repository and put only the minified bundle on chain, and a holder can
 * still prove the small thing they are running is the build of the large thing
 * they can read. Without this, minification is where provenance goes to die:
 * the on-chain bytes are unreadable, the source is unlinked, and "trust me, it
 * is the same code" is the whole argument.
 *
 * ## What makes the answer worth anything
 *
 * `createKeelBuildRecipe` records the *resolved module graph* from esbuild's
 * metafile, not a directory listing. A file the entry point never imports
 * cannot perturb the digest, and one it does import cannot be left out — which
 * is the difference between a recipe that pins a build and one that pins a
 * folder somebody can add to.
 *
 * `verifyKeelBuildRecipe` re-reads every named input, re-runs the build, and
 * compares. When it fails it says which of the three things went wrong — an
 * input changed, the options changed, or the same inputs and options produced
 * different bytes — because "it did not match" alone sends people hunting.
